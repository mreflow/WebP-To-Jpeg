# WebP-To-Jpeg
A simple app for Windows that allows you to drag-n-drop a single or multiple WebP files and bulk convert them to Jpegs

Created with AI using Cursor. Anything I generate with AI is free for anyone to use or build off of. I built this because I wanted a simple drag-n-drop image converter so I didn't need to open an image editor and save files as jpegs.

I'll add instructions to the ReadMe file later but should be pretty self-explanatory. It's a single file.
